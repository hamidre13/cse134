From a presentational perspective, we deviated from the default css that bootstrap provides in favor of a more flat design in our custom site. Functionally, the responsiveness that bootstrap provided was too ambitious to implement in the custom version, so some of it was removed in favor of simpler constructs.
One of the huge advantages of bootstrap is its built-in responsiveness. If we wanted tabs, we wrote the classes to design them, and that in turn provided the functionality needed to toggle content. When we moved to the custom version, we saw that that level of responsiveness was not easy to achieve without a fair amount of javascript. This caused us to shy away from some of the more ambitious constructs that we created with bootstrap, such as the accordion tabs on the tag info page. 
In the home page of our custom design,learn,login,form,all and favorite are actually link to other pages .

We tried to use flat design principle in our custom design. Also we tried to leverage HTML5 tag structure.  
All the pages are mobile friendly.
