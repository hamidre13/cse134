    <h1> The &lt;time&gt; tag</h1>
    
    <p>The &lt;time&gt; element represents either the time on a 24 hour clock
        or a date on a calendar. It is used so machines can easily decipher 
        times and dates from webpages, making scheduling easier, and the overall
        page more accessible.</p>

    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p> Your appointment is scheduled for: <time>10:30</time>. Notice there
        is no default visual difference between a regular paragraph tag and a 
        time tag.
    </p>

    <h2>Example 2 - datetime attribute</h2>
    <p> Your appointment is on:  <time datetime="07-31">July 31st</time>.
        The datetime attribute doesn't have any visual effect, it just used to
        access the time and date by getting the attribute value.
