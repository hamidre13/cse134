<h2> Example </h2>

<p>Farmers try to provide optimal growing conditions for crops by using <em>soil 
    additives to adjust soil pH.</em> Garden lime, or agricultural limestone, is made from pulverized chalk, and can be used to<em> raise the pH of the soil.</em> Clay soil, which is naturally acidic, often requires addition of <em>agricultural lime.</em></p>
