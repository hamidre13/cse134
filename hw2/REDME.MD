We did not include the following tags becuase they are not in html5 spec:
<details>
<dialog>
<marquee>
<menu>
<menuitem>
<summary>


In our Syntax example page we did use details tag which is not yet widely supported, but given that it has a good chanse to become standard tag we used it anyway.

In our wirefram, our example is editable, but because here we are not using and js or css we decided to have static example.
